    "# Text Analysis on customer support tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "With the increase in the popularity of social media and the increased number of users, Social media monitoring has become a very important aspect to companies that aim at maintaining good customer relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media monitoring helps companies not only to interact with customers easily but also they can find the issues or the primary concerns faced by the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of this project is to identify the patterns in the twitter conversations between various companies and their customers in order to identify the primary concerns of the consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "Please find the data set that has been taken from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an unsupervised learning model and Topic modelling techniques (primarily LDA) have been used for the model creation. The hence created model is verified by using the two parameters perplexity score and coherence score.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Describing the Dataset</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains seven columns, each described as below:\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    1. <b>Tweet_id:</b> Unique identification number to identify each tweet<br>\n",
    "    2. <b>Author_id:</b> Unique identification number to identify the user (the one who is tweeting). Numbers have beenused for IDs of customers to maintain privacy<br>\n",
    "    3. <b>Inbound:</b> The value of Inbound is \"True\" if the tweet is tweeted by a user but not the company. Inbound value is \"False\", if the tweet is tweeted by the Company.<br>\n",
    "    4. <b>CreatedDate:</b> Timestamp of the tweet.<br>\n",
    "    5. <b>Text:</b> Text data of the tweet<br>\n",
    "    6. <b>Response_tweet_id:</b> Provides the list of tweet_ids responded to the particular tweet.<br>\n",
    "    7. <b>In_response_to_tweet_id:</b> Provides the tweet_id to which the particular tweet is responding to (in response to which tweet id)<br>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Major Constraints in processing </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "The enormous amount of data present (more than 30 million records) in the data set has been consuming a lot of time to process the machine learning algorithms and also the preprocessing has been taking lot of time and hence only the top 25 companies were selected, but even the top 25 companies were consuimg lot of time for training and preprocessing.Hence we only picked the companies ranking from 21 to 25 in terms of number of tweets. This particular set of companies were selected because they have optimum number of records for preprocessing and training. However the data visualization was done on top 25 comapnies, pre processing and training are done the companies ranked from 21 to 25<br>\n",
